| Folder structure agreed on           | ✅      | Structured by weekly tasks (e.g., 1.3.2/) |
| README initiated                     | ✅      | To be expanded as modules progress     |
| `/minutes` folder created            | ✅      | For saving all team minutes            |

## 5. Reference Material Allocation

Each member selected one document from Canvas (e.g., STM32F3 datasheet, STM32 HAL guide, ARM Cortex-M4 ISA) to review and report back in Week 2 on:
- What the document covers
- When/how it might be useful
