## 3. Progress Summary

### **Exercise 1: Memory and Pointers**
| Subtask                      | Status | Owner       | Notes                                                             |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.3.2a - Upper/Lower convert| âœ…     | Oscar    | Uses ASCII value ranges; toggle based on R2                       |
| 1.3.2b - Palindrome check   | âœ…     | Jiaze    | Clean loop with forward/reverse char comparison                   |
| 1.3.2c - Caesar cipher      | âœ…     | Jason    | Supports +/- shift, with character wrapping and bounds checking   |

----> All three functions tested in isolation and integrated into `string_utils.s`.

---

### **Exercise 2: Digital I/O**
| Subtask                      | Status  | Owner       | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.4.2a - Bitmask LED pattern| âœ…      | Jiaze    | Bitmask stored in register, mapped to GPIOE ODR                      |
| 1.4.2b - Button LED toggle  | âœ…      | Jiaze    | Debouncing handled with loop delay; toggles LED count                |
| 1.4.2c - LED on/off state switch | âœ… | Jiaze    | Logic for mode cycling completed                                     |
| 1.4.2d - Vowel/consonant counter | ðŸ”„ | Oscar    | Partially implemented; planning to integrate with Exercise 1 string input |

----> LEDs working correctly. Button tested for reliability. Integration of vowel/consonant loop planned for next week.

## 4. Technical Challenges & Resolutions

| Issue                           | Resolution                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Button bouncing causing state glitches | Added software delay between state transitions                          |
| Overwriting original string in Caesar cipher | Used separate memory address for output string                        |
| Register usage overflow in nested loops | Defined temp registers and cleared unused ones between calls          |
| GPIO ODR byte alignment issues | Used `[R0, #ODR + 1]` correctly to target bits 8â€“15 of GPIOE ODR         |

---

## 5. Testing Summary

### Manual test cases created for:
- ASCII edge characters (e.g., 'a', 'z', 'A', 'Z')
- Mixed-case palindrome detection
- Positive/negative Caesar shifts (including wrap-around)
- LED display of vowel/consonant counts from test strings

### Tools Used:
- STM32CubeIDE debugger
- Memory/register viewer
- Button press test loop
- LED state snapshotting

## 6. Repository Updates

| Folder     | Update Notes                                                   |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1.3.2/`   | All string-related `.s` files committed and commented          |
| `1.4.2/`   | Bitmask, toggle, and button logic files uploaded               |
| `README.md`| Updated with descriptions of Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 modules|
| `minutes/` | `minutes_6_3.txt` added                                       |

---

## 7. Group Reflection

- Members confirmed a good understanding of memory manipulation in assembly.
- I/O work encouraged deeper appreciation of register-level access and control flow.
- All members are now comfortable using `STRB`, `LDRB`, memory offsets, and GPIO configuration.
