## 2. 🎯 Objective of the Week

- Begin **Exercise 5: Full System Integration**
- Connect and verify serial interface between two STM32 boards
- Route received string through processing pipeline:
  - Palindrome check
  - Caesar cipher (if required)
  - Vowel/consonant count → LED output with timer-based delays

## 3. 🧩 Progress Summary

| Integration Component                    | Status | Owner     | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UART bridging between two boards         | ✅     | [Name A]  | Board A ↔ Board B communication working via UART4/5                   |
| Integration of string input & processing | 🔄     | [Name A]  | Palindrome/cipher logic functional but not fully routed from UART     |
| LED display of vowel/consonant count     | 🔄     | [Name B]  | LED toggle logic and timer loop set up; testing in progress           |
| Shared memory coordination               | ✅     | [Name C]  | Correct string pointers defined; tested across modules                |
| Button trigger for next word             | 🔄     | [Name B]  | Implementation started, needs integration with timer loop             |
| Initial system testing (combined modules)| 🔄     | All       | Partial test passed, LED logic not fully synced with UART yet         |

## 4. ⚠️ Issues Encountered

| Issue                                         | Discussion / Resolution                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple modules accessing same memory        | Separated buffer space and clarified register handoff strategy      |
| LED PWM blinking overlaps with UART receive   | Will stagger UART read + LED update with software handshaking       |
| Button not triggering repeat loop properly    | Suspect debounce or flag logic issue; to debug in next session      |
| Presentation date too early for full polish   | Scheduled **extra meeting before Week 5 demo** to complete testing  |

## 5. 📥 Repository Updates

| Folder     | Updates Made                              | Notes                                     |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `1.7.2/`   | `integration_main.s` created               | Core integration file with shared functions |
| `1.3.2/`, `1.4.2/`, `1.6.2/` | Updated and imported modules        | Modular design used for import and linking |
| `minutes/` | `minutes_Week4.md` added                   | This meeting record                        |

## 6. ✅ What Works So Far

- UART data successfully transfers from PC → Board A → Board B
- All standalone modules (cipher, palindrome, timers, LED) function in isolation
- Repository and folder structure confirmed clean and modular
- All team members aligned on task dependencies and interfaces

## 7. 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

| Task                                             | Owner     | Deadline      |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Complete routing of UART input to logic pipeline | [Name A]  | Before extra meeting |
| Finalize LED count logic with timer delay        | [Name B]  | Before extra meeting |
| Debug and complete button reset/loop trigger     | [Name B]  | Before extra meeting |
| Test full system end-to-end                      | All       | Before Week 5 demo  |
| Update README and documentation for demo         | [Name C]  | Before Week 5 demo  |

## 8. 📆 Scheduled Follow-Up Meeting

We have scheduled an **additional integration session** outside of lab time to complete and test the full project.

| Purpose                 | Final system test, polish, documentation |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 📅 Date & Time          | [Insert Agreed Date/Time]                 |
| 📍 Location             | [Room / Online Link]                      |
| 🧑‍💻 Attendees Expected | Full team                                 |

## 9. 🧭 Group Reflections

- Team communicated well and clearly divided tasks
- Early modular design helped isolate and debug logic
- Time constraints meant integration couldn’t be finalized in one session
- Confident all core logic will be complete before Week 5 presentation
